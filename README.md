A minumum hitting set solver
Given a set M and a collection of its subsets, named N,
we need to find all the minimum hitting sets.
A hitting set (hs) is a subset of M such that its
intersection with all the sets of N is non-empty.
A minimum hitting set (mhs) is a hs such that it does
not contain smaller hs
